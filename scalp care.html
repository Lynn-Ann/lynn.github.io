      Our bodies hold stress in different places. Over the course of the
      pandemic, as I started to double down on my hair care, I began to
      understand just how much pent-up tension I store in my scalp—a realization
      that arrived after I introduced a weekly detoxing scalp massage into my
      routine.
    </p>

    <p>
      "Making space to slow down and simply touch the head creates an awareness
      of the amount of tension stored in the muscles of the scalp and head, as
      well as triggers endorphins that feel good and are good for our bodies,"
      explains New York City trichologist Bridgette Hill, also known as The
      Scalp Therapist, who encouraged me to embrace at-home "scalp facials" at
      the beginning of quarantine. In addition to feeling cathartic, it also
      made me much more aware of the general congestion (dry patches and the
      buildup of natural oils and styling products, in particular) I was
      overlooking and needed to address in a more intentional, attentive, and
      frankly loving way.
    </p>

    <p>
      Building from there, I introduced a host of new tailored rituals and
      treatments, and thus my personal weekly scalp facial regimen was born.
      After a few months of committing to it, I've found that my scalp is much
      happier (i.e. less flakes and no longer tender to the touch), while my
      hair is fuller and more voluminous at the roots especially. From
      increasing scalp awareness to giving yourself a deep-tissue head massage,
      here Hill helps walk through the at-home scalp care process.
    </p>

    <h3>Build Scalp Awareness</h3>

    <p>
      The way Hill sees it, your scalp is the root connection between internal
      health and external beauty. "It's the organ that supports the hair fiber
      through the hair follicles that are located on the scalp," she explains.
      "The quality of these hair follicles is dependent upon the quality of the
      tissue, cells, and blood that fuel the follicle which makes our hair
      fiber." Certain factors such as vitamin deficiencies, health conditions,
      medication side effects, or high cortisol levels due to stress can have a
      negative impact on the hair follicles, which can compromise scalp health
      and lead to issues such as hair shedding, thinning, and a problematic
      scalp. What to look for? "The most common signs of unhealthy scalp are
      general buildup and congestion, which often goes overlooked and
      unaddressed," explains Hill, noting this is most commonly caused by not
      properly shampooing and a slowdown in cellular turnover.
    </p>

    <h3>Think of Your Scalp Like Your Skin</h3>

    <p>
      "I like to think of scalp care as the skinification of hair care,"
      explains Hill. "Depending on the condition and health of the scalp, a
      regimen—whether it is weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly—should be adhered to."
      In this spirit, you want to think about applying the basic steps of
      cleansing, exfoliating, and moisturizing your scalp based on its
      individuals needs. As for what they are, Hill insists your scalp will tell
      you in the form of dandruff, oily scalp, hair loss, or breakage. "In
      acknowledging the natural, authentic state of our scalp health, we can
      connect the factors and actively reset our decisions and choices [to
      improve it]," says Hill. A vital first step? Getting hands on and
      incorporating targeted treatments.
    </p>

    <h3>Treat and Massage Your Scalp</h3>

    <p>
      According to Hill, applying a pre-shampoo scalp oil treatment and giving
      yourself a deep-tissue massage is the first—and most important— step for
      surface scalp health. In choosing a scalp tonic, look for a gentle scrub,
      like Virtue Exfoliating Scalp Treatment or NatureLab Tokyo Perfect Shine
      Clarifying Scalp Scrub, or an oil spiked with ingredients that are known
      to stimulate the scalp, encourage cellular turnover, and reduce
      inflammation. Clean haircare brand Ceremonia's Aceite de Moska is laced
      with flake-fighting Brazillian pataua oil, soothing aloe vera, and
      follicle nourishing castor oil, while Briogeo's tingly mix of purifying
      Binchotan charcoal, soothing peppermint, and antifungal tea tree oil works
      to draw out impurities.
    </p>

    <p>
      To start your deep-tissue scalp massage, Hill instructs beginning at the
      nape of the neck and using both hands to work your fingers up the head,
      kneading from ear to ear for a few minutes to vigorously to lift up oil
      and debris. "Massage helps relax the scalp and increase suppleness,"
      explains Hill. "We know stress tightens the scalp and impedes circulation
      and hair growth, so weekly scalp massages are an excellent for our overall
      health and well being." After you work the treatment into your scalp, make
      sure you leave it on for at least 15 minutes to allow it to penetrate the
      scalp, hair follicles, and hair shaft.
    </p>

    <h3>Cleanse the Scalp Thoroughly</h3>

    <p>
      When it comes time to cleanse your hair, you want to be sure you're doing
      so thoroughly and with the right gentle cleansing shampoo. If you're
      looking to fight off flakes, consider using a dandruff shampoo, such as
      Jupiter's Balancing Shampoo or Oribe's Serene Scalp Shampoo, once a week,
      or monthly depending on how often you wash your hair. Additionally, Hill
      encourages her clients to invest in a special bottle with a tapered
      applicator tip that allows for better control in application. Another tool
      that can be helpful both in depositing pre-shampoo treatments and for a
      more rigorous cleanse in the shower is a scalp brush with flexible
      bristles, such as Briogeo's Scalp Revival Stimulating Therapy Massager or
      Leonor Greyl's Massaging Scalp Scrubber. "Begin brushing at the nape of
      the neck on either side of the head and brush forward towards the heart,"
      says Hill. "Repeat that action working around the entire head." Just be
      sure not to overdo it—overstimulating your scalp can cause irritation, or
      even damage, if you do too much in one sitting.
    </p>

    <h3>Supercharge the Scalp</h3>

    <p>
      To keep your scalp smooth and supple, you must restore the moisture that
      may have been lost in the cleansing process. Look to a tonic that will
      lock in hydration while also considering your specific scalp concerns,
      such as dryness or hair growth. A serum like Act + Acre's cold-pressed
      Stem Cell Serum imparts a cooling effect as collagen-boosting apple stem
      cells, protective bamboo leaf extract, and soothing aloe vera work
      together to rejuvenate the scalp. Then for an in-between wash refresh,
      dr°k Daily Spray—a lightweight cocktail of tea tree oil, shea butter, and
      aloe leaf juice—can be misted on the scalp and hair to nourish roots, keep
      hair follicles unclogged, and fight itchy scalp. As is the case for the
      skin on your face, the scalp must stay hydrated and healthy to keep up the
      momentum.
