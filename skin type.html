      Figuring out your skin type can be challenging for a few reasons. The
      first is that there are quite a few different skin types (oily skin, dry
      skin, sensitive skin, combination skin and normal skin), the second is
      that your skin can fall into two different categories at the same time and
      finally, there are outside factors that can affect your complexion, such
      as the weather, pollution and more.
    </p>

    <h3>How Can I Identify My Skin Type?</h3>

    <h4>Normal Skin</h4>
    <p>
      Normal skin is often balanced (read: not too oily, not too dry) throughout
      the day, though it can still show signs of occasional oiliness or dryness.
    </p>

    <h4>Oily Skin</h4>
    <p>
      The easiest way to spot an oily complexion? Shiny skin. Because sebaceous
      glands among oily skin types are more active, the skin may be more prone
      to breakouts and blemishes.
    </p>

    <p>
      To help you determine if you fall into this category, Dr. Bhanusali
      recommends trying this quick test: “Grab a blotting paper and gently dab
      different areas of your face,” he says. “If the sheet becomes translucent,
      it’s indicative of oil absorption.”
    </p>

    <h4>Dry Skin</h4>

    <p>
      Dry skin can appear flaky. According to the American Academy of
      Dermatology (AAD), dry skin may also appear dull and occasionally feel
      itchy.
    </p>

    <h4>Combination Skin</h4>

    <p>
      “Combination skin is by far the most common skin type I see in my
      patients,” says Dr. Bhanusali. “They come in with an oily T-zone (nose,
      eyebrows and chin) and dry skin at the periphery.”
    </p>

    <h4>Sensitive Skin</h4>

    <p>
      If you have sensitive skin, then you probably experience frequent
      irritations or redness to skincare ingredients like acids, retinol,
      essential oils and even fragrances.
