    <h3>Lifestyle</h3>
    <p>
      Moderation and regularity are good things, but not everyone can sleep
      eight hours, eat three healthy meals per day, and drink plenty of water a
      day. Probably the most useful lifestyle change one can make is never to
      pick or squeeze pimples. Playing with or popping pimples, no matter how
      careful and clean one is, nearly always makes bumps stay redder and
      bumpier longer. People often refer to redness as "scarring," but
      fortunately, it usually isn't permanent. It's just a mark that takes
      months to fade if left entirely alone.
    </p>

    <h3>Open the Pores</h3>
    <p>
      Occasional visits to an esthetician who is an expert at safely removing
      blackheads during a facial can be beneficial.
    </p>

    <h3>Cleansing and Skincare</h3>
    <p>
      Despite what one might read in a popular style and fashion magazines,
      there is no magic product or regimen that is right for every person and
      situation.
    </p>

    <h4>Mild Cleansers</h4>
    <p>
      Washing once or twice a day with a mild cleansing bar or liquid (for
      example, Dove, Neutrogena, Basis, Purpose, and Cetaphil are all
      inexpensive and popular) will keep the skin clean and minimize sensitivity
      and irritation.
    </p>

    <h4>Exfoliating Cleansers and Masks</h4>
    <p>
      A variety of mild scrubs, exfoliants, and masks can be used. These
      products may contain salicylic acid in a concentration that makes it a
      very mild peeling agent. These products remove the outer layer of the skin
      and thus open pores. Products containing glycolic or alpha hydroxy acids
      are also gentle skin exfoliants.
    </p>

    <h4>Retinol</h4>
    <p>
      ot to be confused with the prescription medication Retin-A, this
      derivative of vitamin A can help promote skin peeling.
    </p>

    <h3>Reducing Bacteria</h3>
    <h4>Antibacterial Cleansers</h4>
    <p>
      The most popular ingredient in over-the-counter antibacterial cleansers is
      benzoyl peroxide.
    </p>

    <h4>Topical (External) Applications:</h4>
    <p>
      Antibacterial cleansers come in the form of gels, creams, and lotions that
      are applied to the affected area. The active ingredients that kill surface
      bacteria include benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, and resorcinol. Some brands
      promoted on the Internet and cable TV (such as ProActiv) are much more
      costly than identical and sometimes more potent products one can buy in
      the drugstore.
    </p>

    <p>
      Benzoyl peroxide causes red and scaly skin irritation in a small number of
      people, which goes away as soon as one stops using the product. Keep in
      mind that benzoyl peroxide is a bleach, so do not let products containing
      benzoyl peroxide come into contact with fabrics, leaving unsightly white
      spots on colored clothes, shirts, towels, and carpets.
    </p>

    <h3>Reduce Excess Oil</h3>
    <p>
      One cannot stop oil glands from producing oil. Even isotretinoin
      (Accutane, see below) only slows down oil glands for a while; they resume
      normal activity later. It is possible to get rid of oil on the surface of
      the skin and reduce the appearance of shine.
    </p>

      <li id="p1">Products containing glycolic acid or one of the other alpha hydroxy acids
